## Getting Started

To work with this repository, the author recommends 2 options

1) Using code space in GitHub. This option will avoid the installation of programs and code packages. A principal limitation of this system is the restriction to 60 hours of free usage; once this allocation is exhausted, continued access requires payment.
2) Installing [Visual studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) and [Anaconda ]( https://www.anaconda.com/download/). Anaconda includes all the necessary packages to run the code ( for example NumPy or matplotlib)
