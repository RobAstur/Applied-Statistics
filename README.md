## Overview

The aim of this repository is to address four statistical problems: Extending the Lady Tasting Tea, Normal Distribution, t-tests, and ANOVA.
The code and simulations for the four problems can be found in this repository in the Jupyter notebook called problems.ipynb. 

## Getting Started

To work with this repository, the author recommends 2 options:

1) Using code space in GitHub Codespace. This option avoids the need to install programs or code packages. A principal limitation of this system is the restriction to 60 hours of free usage; once this allocation is exhausted, continued access requires payment.
2) Installing [Visual studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) and [Anaconda ]( https://www.anaconda.com/download/). Anaconda includes all the necessary packages to run the code (for example NumPy or Matplotlib)
